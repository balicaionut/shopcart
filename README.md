#### Description
The project was made in collaboration with https://github.com/Popa-Andrei-Valentin and https://github.com/innenrinde. It was originaly intended for Vue.js training purposes at the company where I was doing the Vue.js Frontend Developer internship. After complition, the project could be inserted into personal portfolio.
